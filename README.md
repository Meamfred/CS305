Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
- Artemis Financial is a company that stores privilaged personal financial information for clients. The company wanted their application's security to be tested and any issues resolved.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
- I ran dependancies to find vulnerabilities in the application. These were resolved by updating vulnerable versions to a newer and more secure version. The companies overall well-being is greatly enhanced by increases in security and the implementation of a cypher to protect sensitive data.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
- The most challenging part of the assessment was creating and implementing the cypher. It took me many hours to learn how to find the location of the cypher on my computer. After finding its location, adding it to the application and imlementing its use was also difficult.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
- The layers of security were increased by updating vulnerabilities in the program, wrting the code in a more secure fashion, and the implementation of a cypher. These were used to keep the program in line with industry standards.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- I tested the code for usability and ran a vulnerability check. After implementing the needed updates and changes, I resumed testing for vulnerabilites until none were found and all false positives were removed.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- I liked learning how to use Maven to learn about the vulnerabilities of different programs. I also liked the ability to generate a cypher from my own computer using functionalities that are already present in the standard version of java.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
- I would show a future employer the vulnerability assesments and the implementation of the cypher to prove my understanding of the concepts behind these functions and to show my ability to adhere to industry security standards.
